### Enumeration 

Starting off with a basic enumeration scan: ```nmap -sC -sV -oA granny 10.10.10.14```. Here's the result:

We see that port ```80``` is open that's hosting an IIS webserver. Doing a previous challenge [Granny](https://github.com/BurntxNoodle/PenetrationTesting/tree/master/HTB%20-%20Granny) I learned about WebDAV and this box also seems to have some WebDAV funcitonality. I do a similar ```davtest``` scan. Here's the result:

Meanwhile, in the background, I run a ```gobuster``` script to see if there's any additional directories. The command I did was ```gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.14 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt```. And this is what it found:

```
/images (Status: 301)
/Images (Status: 301)
/IMAGES (Status: 301)
/_private (Status: 403)
```

```Status: 403``` means we don't have access to that directory, ```Status: 301``` is a URL redirection, but we can access it.

So basically from our findings, we see the only open port is ```80``` with WebDAV. But with this WebDAV (unlike HackTheBox grandma), we cannot upload files so we can't upload an ```.asp``` file to execute and get a reverse shell. 

I decided to do some googling:

[The first link](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl) by Rapid7 shows the module ```exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl```. 

### Exploitation

Using the module, configuring the settings, then later executing the exploit, we get a meterpreter shell.

In meterpreter, I do ```shell``` to get a native windows shell. Doing a ```whoami``` check outputs ```nt authority\network service```. This isn't the administrator account.

Next, something I learned by doing this HackTheBox challenge is to migrate processes to a different process that you own or a process that's the same architecture as your exploit/payload. So for this challenge, I migrate to a process that I own (as ```nt authority\network service```. 

*NOTE: When doing this challenge, the meterpreter session kept closing randomly. I think it's due to the process that I migrated to so I suggest trying a different process if possible.

### Privesc

First step I do is to use a metasploit module that will collect a list of known exploits based on the system information you have on the machine and then suggests you a list of exploits that may work. 

```
msf5 exploit(windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl) > search suggester

Trying the first exploit listed (```exploit/windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d```) that "appears to be vulnerable" by ended up crashing the box so that didn't work.

Trying the second exploit (```exploit/windows/local/ms14_070_tcpip_ioctl```) that "appears to be vulnerable" by ended up getting me a shell:

### Getting Root/User flags

Eventually I wander into this directory that contains an ```Administrator``` directory and a ```Harry``` directory that looks to be a user on the box.

Checking the ```Desktop``` inside each of those reveals the Root flag and the User flag

### Flags

Root: ```C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt```

User: ```C:\Documents and Settings\Harry\Desktop\user.txt```
