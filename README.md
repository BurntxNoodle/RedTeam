# Penetration Testing / Offensive Security / Red Team Stuff

Currently learning penetration testing/offensive security. I learn by doing hands-on practice and doing writeups that I post here. This README will also contain other resources, labs, websites, and tools that I found helpful.

### Info/Format of the Repo:
- [! Commands](https://github.com/BurntxNoodle/PenetrationTesting/tree/master/!%20Commands): Contains list of past commands that I've used that are helpful, that are now more easily accessible.
- [HackTheBox Writeups](https://github.com/BurntxNoodle/RedTeam/tree/master/HackTheBox%20Writeups): [Table of Contents here](https://github.com/BurntxNoodle/RedTeam#HackTheBox-Table-of-Contents). Contains my writeups to retired HackTheBox machines that I have done. 
- [Networking Notes](https://github.com/BurntxNoodle/RedTeam/tree/master/Networking%20Notes): Contains my written notes on computer networking as I believe it's important to learn networking to be effective in network pentesting. Content based on CCNA and CompTIA Network+ certs.
